## Thoughts and Improvements

I believe this is my least successful project. I struggled a lot with placements and think there are a lot of improvements I can do. One big improvements is better layout and adding in TV shows as of right now it is all Movies. I would also like to allow bookmarking and make use of user accounts. Another feature is to allow guest access vs user access with username and password. This way guests can see what I watched and liked as well as see what I'm currently watching or seeing or expecting to see.
